# Basic-Calculator
Basically we know that generally calculators have limit of accepting the numbers as input for performing the required operation on them. If we have a large numbers for performing a specified operation on them we are struggling for that, hence in this project i am designing a basic calculator that accepts any number of elements as input and performs the necessary basic  operations include Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division on them.The code for this basic calculator is written in C programming language.This is user friendly calculator that performs basic operations for any number of inputs.
